# AL code review

Reviews AL source changes by composing the leaf AL review skills. This is the canonical reference implementation of a **super-skill** — skill authors writing composed reviews should copy its structure.

`al-code-review` does not evaluate knowledge files directly. It invokes each of its sub-skills against the same task input, collects their findings-reports, and returns a rolled-up findings-report.

An orchestrator invokes this skill with either a `pr-diff` (the standard PR-review entry point) or a `file-path` (single-file review). The skill produces a single JSON document conforming to the DO output contract, extended with `sub-results` and — when applicable — `skipped-sub-skills`.

## Source

The sub-skills invoked by this skill are those listed in frontmatter `sub-skills`:

- `microsoft/skills/review/al-performance-review.md`
- `microsoft/skills/review/al-security-review.md`
- `microsoft/skills/review/al-privacy-review.md`
- `microsoft/skills/review/al-upgrade-review.md`
- `microsoft/skills/review/al-style-review.md`
- `microsoft/skills/review/al-ui-review.md`

Additional leaf skills (for example, telemetry, testing) are added by updating the `sub-skills` list. The skill does not discover sub-skills implicitly.

## Relevance

A sub-skill is relevant when both of the following hold:

- The orchestrator has supplied inputs that satisfy the sub-skill's declared `inputs`.
- The orchestrator has not disabled the sub-skill via configuration.

Per the DO contract, the super-skill MUST NOT filter sub-skills by task content. `al-code-review` does not inspect the PR diff to predict whether, for example, there is anything for `al-security-review` to find. Each leaf is responsible for its own task-level applicability decision; leaves signal non-applicability by returning `outcome: "not-applicable"` or `outcome: "no-knowledge"`.

Sub-skills that fail either check are not invoked and are recorded in `skipped-sub-skills`:

- `reason: "configuration"` when the orchestrator disabled the sub-skill.
- `reason: "not-applicable"` when the orchestrator's inputs do not satisfy the sub-skill's declared `inputs`.

## Worklist

The worklist is the list of sub-skills judged relevant by the previous step. Every sub-skill in the worklist will be invoked in the Action step.

## Action

For each sub-skill in the worklist:

1. Invoke the sub-skill with the orchestrator's inputs, passing only the subset each sub-skill declares in its `inputs`.
2. Capture the sub-skill's complete findings-report verbatim and append it to `sub-results`.
3. If the sub-skill's `outcome` is `failed`, stop here for this sub-skill: its findings are not reliable per the DO contract and MUST NOT be copied into the super-skill's top-level `findings[]` or counted in `summary.counts`.
4. Otherwise, append each entry from the sub-skill's `findings[]` to the super-skill's top-level `findings[]`, setting `from-sub-skill` to the sub-skill's `skill.id`. For non-citation findings (those whose `id` is a skill-defined slug rather than a reference path), prefix `id` with `<from-sub-skill>:` to prevent collisions across sub-skills. Other finding fields are preserved.

Aggregate `summary.counts` and `summary.coverage` as the sums across invoked sub-skills whose `outcome` is not `failed`.

`suppressed[]` at the super-skill level remains empty. Knowledge-file-level suppression is reported by each sub-skill within its own entry in `sub-results`.

Derive `outcome` using the DO rollup rules. `outcome-reason` is populated for `partial` and `failed` and SHOULD summarize per-sub-skill state, for example: *"al-security-review failed (tool timeout); al-performance-review completed."*

## Output

Output conforms to the DO output contract, extended with `sub-results` and `skipped-sub-skills`. A populated example — both leaves ran, each produced findings:
