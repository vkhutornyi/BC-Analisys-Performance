# Do not prompt the user inside a write transaction

> Contributions welcome — open a PR to refine or extend this article.

## Description

Confirm, StrMenu, Message, and any other user-facing dialog pauses execution while the transaction is still open. During that pause every lock held by the transaction blocks other sessions. A user who walks away from the screen can suspend business-critical tables for an unbounded period.

## Best Practice

Gather every user decision before the writing phase begins. Once the decisions are known, run the transaction end-to-end without prompts.

See sample: `avoid-user-interaction-in-transactions.good.al`.

## Anti Pattern

Calling Confirm or StrMenu from inside an OnInsert, OnModify, or OnDelete trigger — or from any code path that has already started modifying records — blocks on user input while holding locks.

See sample: `avoid-user-interaction-in-transactions.bad.al`.
